# Tic-tac-toe vs Bot

Another tic-tac-toe game. Last time I was doing tic-tac-toe tutorial from the official react docs.

The tutorial was great, but I'm the one who controls the X's and O's; because I'm a loner. So what's gonna make me a better loner? Yes! Fight with a bot. And I found a video: [Tic Tac Toe with React.js
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7lLLMTeTVo) that will help me to achieve that. Let's gooo!!

> I'm feelin lonely. Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me. Now I'm crying in my room... ðŸ˜­
